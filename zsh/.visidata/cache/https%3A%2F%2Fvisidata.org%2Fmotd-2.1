Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.
What happened last night can happen again.
This message was left intentionally blank.
Stay away from hurricanes for a while.
The time is right to make new friends.
Afraid of your valuables being stolen?
A good workman is known by his tools.
Today is what happened to yesterday.
Make a wish, it might come true.
Someone is speaking well of you.
Think about what you're doing.
Reply hazy, ask again later.
Forever is composed of nows.
There is no place like home.
Do ya feel lucky, textpunk?
Success is a poor teacher.
What we think, we become.
Carry more junk.
Take a breath.
Pay attention.
Don't panic.
Be here now.
Let it go.
Be nice.
Stretch.
Listen.
Your friend is your needs answered.
Your joy is your sorrow unmasked.
The ocean laughs always with the innocent.
Your daily life is your religion.
Even while the earth sleeps we travel.
Let your best be for your friend.
Much of your pain is self-chosen.
Your house is your larger body.
Why seek you the unattainable?
Work is love made visible.
And how else can it be?
There ought to be a book written about me!
Was I the same when I got up this morning?
You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!
Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
I can see you're trying to invent something!
Come, there's no use in crying like that!
And yesterday things went on just as usual.
I wonder if I've been changed in the night?
Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!
What else have you got in your pocket?
As if I would talk on such a subject!
How puzzling all these changes are!
I've something important to say!
Have you guessed the riddle yet?
Silence all round, if you please!
Mine is a long and a sad tale!
Why, it fills the whole window!
I wonder what they'll do next!
Stop this moment, I tell you!
What size do you want to be?
What day of the month is it?
It's always six o'clock now.
That WAS a narrow escape!
What are you thinking of?
Who ever saw one that size?
Oh, I beg your pardon!
What WILL become of me?
A likely story indeed!
Are you content now?
But what am I to do?
Explain yourself!
Is that all?
Oh dear!
